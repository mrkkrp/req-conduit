This library extends functionality of
the [`req`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/req) package
with [`conduit`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit) helpers for
streaming big request bodies in constant space.

## Potential issues

Streaming of request body does not happen in constant memory. But it does
not work with `http-conduit` either, see:
https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/issues/240. Streaming of response
body does happen in constant memory as expected. See the benchmarks coming
with the library for hands-on experiences.
